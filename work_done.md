# Work Done

Date: 2026-02-03

## Resources Read
- `README.md`
- `guides/vehicle_calendar_blueprint.txt`
- `guides/vehicle_calendar_guideline.txt`
- `document/srs/SRS_v01.docx` (text extracted)

## Notes / Decisions (User Clarifications)
- Log retention is **30 days** (not 3). SRS had an error; user will correct.
- **Permanent deletion** for members and vehicles (not soft delete). User will adjust guideline and SRS.
- **Override notifications are in scope** and must be sent when a booking is overridden.
- Members **cannot cancel** once a booking has started; cancellation allowed only **before** start time.
- **All-day bookings** must be available.

## Limitations Encountered
- `document/ui_wireframes/ui_wireframe_handsketch.pdf` could not be read due to missing PDF rendering tools; file appears to be image-only.

## Update
